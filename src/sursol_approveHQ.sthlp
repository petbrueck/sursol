{pstd}
{opt sursol [un]approveHQ} (un)approves interviews as headquarter on a Survey Solutions server for which the {it:if} condition is true. {p_end}

{pstd}
The command lists all 32-character long identifier of the interviews for which the {it:if} condition is true in the current dataset. If not specified in {opt id(varlist)}, 
the command uses the Survey Solutions system generated variable "interview__id" by default.{p_end}

{pstd}
An installed version of R Statistical Software is required. The command shell returns warnings if (1) interviews was in status that was not ready to be (un)approved or (2)  interviews have been not found. {p_end}

{pstd}
Interviews can be approved as Headuqarter with the following status only: {it:Completed} and {it:Approved by Supervisor}.  {p_end}

{pstd} 
Interviews can be unapproved with the following status only: {it:Approved by Headquarters}. {p_end}

{dlgtab:Required}

{marker server}{...}
{phang}
{opt serv:er(string)} specifies the server on which the survey is hosted. Full URL required: Protocol (e.g. {it:https://}), hostname (e.g. {it:projectX.mysurvey.solutions}) and any other URL information.
A typical server URL for servers hosted by the World Bank: {it: https://projectX.mysurvey.solutions}

{phang}
{opt user(string)} specifies the login name of an API account created on the server itself. 

{phang}
{opt password(string)} the corresponding password of the API account specified in {opt user(string)}. 


{marker optiona}{...}
{dlgtab:Optional}

{phang}
{opt comm:ent(string)} text to be attached to approval. Comment will be visible in the Status History as well as final survey data set. If not specified, the following comment will be attached: "Approved by HQ through APIUser: `user'" 
where `user' is specified in {opt user(string)}

{phang}
{opt id:(var)} by default, the command uses the variable {browse "https://support.mysurvey.solutions/headquarters/export/system-generated-export-file-anatomy/":interview__id} as the unique identifier of each interview. 
If interview__id has been renamed {opt id:(var)} can be used to indicate the new variable. Must be unique 32-character long identifier generated by Survey Solutions.

{marker sursol_approveHQ_rpath}{...}
{phang}
{opt rpath(string)} specifies the path to the R.exe through which the data export request to the server is transmitted. Required if non-windows OS. By default, and if windows as OS is used, {opt sursol [un]approveHQ} assumes that the executable  
can be found in "C:\Program Files\R\R-X.X.X\bin\xBITVERSION\". It returns errors if it is not possible to detect any executable in the default or specified folder.

{title:Debugging}

{pstd} If you encounter the problem that the windows/mac shell box opens but closes shortly after without any interviews being [un]approved by HQ: {p_end}
{pstd}{cmd:sursol [un]approveHQ} relies on various R packages. By default, those R packages are being installed if the command can not locate the packages.{p_end} 
{pstd}However, some users reported that this is not working properly. This is most likely because of Stata / Windows or Mac Shell Box not having administrator rights to install the packages.{p_end}
{pstd}Therefore, try to install the following packages manually in R by opening R, either in IDE's such as RStudio or R.exe itself: {p_end}

{synoptline}
{pstd}	install.packages("stringr", repos = 'https://cloud.r-project.org/', dep = TRUE){p_end}
{pstd} 	install.packages("lubridate", repos = 'https://cloud.r-project.org/', dep = TRUE){p_end}
{pstd}	install.packages("jsonlite", repos = 'https://cloud.r-project.org/', dep = TRUE){p_end}
{pstd}	install.packages("httr", repos = 'https://cloud.r-project.org/', dep = TRUE){p_end}
{pstd} 	install.packages("dplyr", repos = 'https://cloud.r-project.org/', dep = TRUE){p_end}
{pstd}	install.packages("date", repos = 'https://cloud.r-project.org/', dep = TRUE){p_end}
{synoptline}

{pstd}Make sure that you have administrator rights. Afterwards, {cmd:sursol [un]approveHQ} should run. {p_end}

{title:Examples}

{pstd}Load survey dataset and approve interviews if they have no errors flagged by the Survey Solutions software{p_end}
