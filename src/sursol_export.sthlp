{title:Description}

{pstd}
{opt sursol export} performs data export of survey data from a Survey Solutions server using your locally installed R.exe through the Windows Command Shell.

{pstd}
The command identifies data on the server corresponding to {it:questionnaire_name} and requests the data to be generated on the server. 
If successful, the data will be exported to the path specified in {opt dir:ectory(string)} in ZIP format. Unless not requested, all files will be unzipped. 
An installed version of R Statistical Software is required. Each Survey Solutions version of {it:questionnaire_name} will be treated seperately.


{marker syntax}{...}
{title:Syntax}

{dlgtab:Required}

{phang}
{it: questionnaire_name} requests a list of all questionnaire versions available on the server corresponding to {it: questionnaire_name}. Case insensitive. Error message is displayed if no questionnaire is found. 

{marker directory}{...}
{phang}
{opt dir:ectory(string)} specifies the path in which the exported ZIP files will be saved. By default all exported ZIP files will be unzipped into this path unless {opt nozip} or {opt zipdir(string)} is specified.

{phang}
{opt serv:er(string)} specifies the server on which the survey is hosted. Only prefix of domain name required: PREFIX.mysurvey.solutions. Full domain name, protocol and other URL information will be added automatically. 

{phang}
{opt user(string)} specifies the login name of an API account created on the server itself. 

{phang}
{opt password(string)} the corresponding password of the API account specified in {opt user(string)}. 


{marker optiona}{...}
{dlgtab:Optional}

{phang}
{opt format(string)} can be used to specify the format of the main survey data to be exported. Can be one or combination of any of the following: "stata", "spss" or "tabular". By default, only stata format (.dta files) will be exported.

{marker versions}{...}
{phang}
{opt versions(numlist)} by default, {opt sursol export} requests all versions that are found on the server to be exported.
If {opt versions(numlist)} is specified, only respective versions of {it:questionnaire_name} are exported. 
Versions can be specified in any order and using either "," or " " as a delimiter. 
For example, {opt versions(1 3 4)} or {opt versions(4,3,1)} both request to download Version 1,3 and 4 of the specified questionnaire. 

{marker lastversion}{...}
{phang}
{opt lastv:ersion} if specified, only the most recent version that can be found on the server of {it:questionnaire_name} will be exported. Can not be used in conjunction with {opt versions(numlist)}.

{phang}
{opt para:data} requests to export corresponding paradata which contains metadata on the interview process (events and timing).

{phang}
{opt bin:ary} can be used to export corresponding binary data which contains for example contains pictures or recored audio sequences. 

{phang}
{opt status(string)} only requests to export data with a specific status. By default, all interviews of {it:questionnaire_name} are exported. {it:status(string)} 
can be specified by using one of the following statuses:

		 {hline 33}
        	  ApprovedByHeadquarters  
	 	  ApprovedBySupervisor                 
          	  RejectedByHeadquarters
          	  RejectedBySupervisor 
          	  Completed              
         	  Restarted
	  	  SentToCapi
	  	  ReadyForInterview
	  	  InterviewerAssigned
	  	  SupervisorAssigned
	  	  Created
	  	  Restored
	  	  Deleted             
	 	{hline 33}

{phang}
{opt nozip} if specified, the exported ZIP files will not be unzipped. 

{phang}
{opt zipdir(string)} by default, and if {opt nozip} is not specified, {opt sursol export} unzipps the exported exported ZIP files and stores them in {opt dir:ectory(string)}. 
If this is not convenient for the user {opt zipdir(string)} specifies the path in which the unzipped files should be stored. {opt nozip} and {opt zipdir(string)} can not be specified together. 

{phang}
{opt start:date(string)} by default, {opt sursol export} requests to export all data irrespective when the last change to an interview was done. If one is interested only in a specific time frame from date X forward, 
{opt start:date(string)} can be specified in UTC date ({it:YYYY-MM-DD}). Please note, date specified refers to the last change that has been done for an interview not the date on which the interview took place. 

{phang}
{opt end:date(string)} similar to {opt start:date(string)}, one can determine to export only interviews for which changes have been made until date specified in {opt end:date(string)}. Must also be specified in UTC date ({it:YYYY-MM-DD}).

{marker sursol_export_rpath}{...}
{phang}
{opt rpath(string)} specifies the path to the R.exe through which the data export request to the server is transmitted. Required if non-windows OS. By default, and if windows as OS is used, {opt sursol export} assumes that the executable  
can be found in "C:\Program Files\R\R-X.X.X\bin\xBITVERSION\". It returns errors if it is not possible to detect any executable in the default or specified folder.

{title:Debugging}

{pstd} If you encounter the problem that the windows/mac shell box opens but closes shortly after without any data being exported: {p_end}
{pstd}{cmd:sursol export} relies on various R packages. By default, those R packages are being installed if the command can not locate the packages.{p_end} 
{pstd}However, some users reported that this is not working properly.{p_end}
{pstd}Therefore, try to install the following packages manually in R by opening R, either in applications such as RStudio or R.exe itself: {p_end}

{synoptline}
{pstd}	install.packages("stringr", repos = 'https://cloud.r-project.org/', dep = TRUE){p_end}
{pstd} 	install.packages("tidyverse", repos = 'https://cloud.r-project.org/', dep = TRUE){p_end}
{pstd} 	install.packages("lubridate", repos = 'https://cloud.r-project.org/', dep = TRUE){p_end}
{pstd}	install.packages("jsonlite", repos = 'https://cloud.r-project.org/', dep = TRUE){p_end}
{pstd}	install.packages("httr", repos = 'https://cloud.r-project.org/', dep = TRUE){p_end}
{pstd} 	install.packages("dplyr", repos = 'https://cloud.r-project.org/', dep = TRUE){p_end}
{pstd}	install.packages("date", repos = 'https://cloud.r-project.org/', dep = TRUE){p_end}
{synoptline}

Afterwards, {cmd:sursol export} should run.
