{title:Description}

{pstd}
{opt sursol getcomms} aims to attach all comments that have been left by Users to an interview to the respective variables within the survey data files. 

{pstd}
Survey Solutions exports all comments that are left by Interviewer, Supervisor, Headquarter or Admin Users within the{browse "https://support.mysurvey.solutions/headquarters/export/system-generated-export-file-anatomy/": System Generated File} 
interview__comments.dta. 

{pstd}
In many scenarios it might be useful to have the comments in one place, next to the question/variable that the comment was attached to. To this end, this command identifies all comments within interview__comments.dta and merges it 
with the survey data using the suffix "_comm". 

{pstd}
For each comment, the Role of the person that left the comment (e.g. Interviewer) is attached to the comment.

{pstd}
If multiple comments are left at one question, the chronological order of comments is indicated. E.g. 1. Interviewer: "First comment", 2. Supervisor: "Second comment".

{pstd}
For comments left at questions that are placed within a roster the interview__id + respective roster id is used to correctly attribute the comment to the correct roster item. 

{pstd}
{it: {opt ATTENTION:}}: If there are nested rosters that require multiple roster id's, the command identifies all variables that have the suffix "__id" and assumes that the order of 
those variables aligns with the level of nesting of such rosters. It is therefore advised to use this command with a very early version of the exported data. 
If the roster variables have been reordered before running this command will produce an incorrect output!
