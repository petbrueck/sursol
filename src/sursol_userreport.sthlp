{pstd}
{opt sursol userreport} downloads the full interviewer report for all interviewer user accounts from a Survey Solutions server using your locally installed R.exe through the Command Shell.  {p_end}

{pstd}
The command requests to export the interviewer report which also can be manually downloaded from the server via{p_end}
{pstd}
"Teams and Roles" -> "Interviewers" -> "Download report as XLSX, CSV, or TAB".  {p_end}

{pstd}
This report contains information about the users device, recent synchronizations activities and connection statistics.{p_end}

{pstd}  
If successful, the report will be exported to the path specified in {opt dir:ectory(string)} in either .xlsx, .csv or .tab format. {p_end}

{opt dir:ectory(string)} specifies the path in which the interviewer report will be saved. Existing files "Interviewers" will be overwritten. 

{marker server}{...}
{phang}
{opt serv:er(url)} specifies the server on which the survey is hosted. Full URL required: Protocol (e.g. {it:https://}), hostname (e.g. {it:projectX.mysurvey.solutions}) and any other URL information.
A typical server URL for servers hosted by the World Bank: {it: https://projectX.mysurvey.solutions}

{opt hquser(string)} specifies the user name of an Headquarter account. {cmd:Important:} Do not use the credentials of an API user.

{marker sursol_userreport_rpath}{...}
{phang}
{opt rpath(string)} specifies the path to the R.exe through which the data export request to the server is transmitted. Required if non-windows OS. By default, and if windows as OS is used, {opt sursol userreport} assumes that the executable  
can be found in "C:\Program Files\R\R-X.X.X\bin\xBITVERSION\". It returns errors if it is not possible to detect any executable in the default or specified folder.

{title:Debugging}

{pstd} If you encounter the problem that the windows/mac shell box opens but closes shortly after without any report being exported: {p_end}
{pstd}{cmd:sursol userreport} relies on various R packages. By default, those R packages are being installed if the command can not locate the packages.{p_end} 
{pstd}However, some users reported that this is not working properly. This is most likely because of Stata / Windows or Mac Shell Box not having administrator rights to install the packages.{p_end}
{pstd}Therefore, try to install the following packages manually in R by opening R, either in IDE' such as RStudio or R.exe itself: {p_end}

{synoptline}
{pstd}	install.packages("httr", repos = 'https://cloud.r-project.org/', dep = TRUE){p_end}
{pstd}	install.packages("xlsx", repos = 'https://cloud.r-project.org/', dep = TRUE){p_end}
{synoptline}

{pstd}Make sure that you have administrator rights. Afterwards, {cmd:sursol userreport} should run. {p_end}
