{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:sursol transcheck} can be used to identify software-related misalignments between an Original Text and its Translation.  {p_end}
{pstd}
In any CAPI-software, it is of importance that the translation of questionnaire items, also contain software codes that have been included in the 
original script. Those codes mainly imply html-code for formatting text as well as software "substitutions" which are used to reference previous given answers in e.g. a question text or error messages. {p_end}

{pstd}
Especially for large and complex surveys, machine-readable translation files contain too much text to check for consistency. 
This command will flag misalignments if:  {p_end}

{pstd} 
a) Text substitutions (e.g. %rostertitle%) or HTML tags, or HTML tags if {opt html} is specified, are to be found in the {it:Original} but not in the {it:Translation} text and vice versa{p_end}

{pstd} 
b) The number of text substitutions, or HTML tags if {opt html} is specified, differs between the {it:Original} and the {it:Translation} text. E.g. two times %rostertitle% used in {it:Original} but only once in {it:Translation}.{p_end}

{pstd} 
The command creates the following variables, if applicable:{p_end}

		{hline 20}
        	problem 
		sub_missing_trans   
		sub_missing_orig 
		html_missing_trans
		html_missing_orig 
		no_translation
